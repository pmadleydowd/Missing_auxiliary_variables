This repository contains all the scripts and the folder structure required to perform the simulation study and applied example for the manuscript "Analyses using multiple imputation need to consider missing data in auxiliary variables": https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.11.23299810v1. 

Folder structure
	- datafiles:	Contains all the data. Note that the raw data for the simulations are not included in the git repository in order to reduce storage but can be obtained by running the scripts. Combined datasets are included here. No ALSPAC data for the applied example are held in the repository. 
	- dofiles: 	Contains all do files needed to run the simulation study and applied example
	- graphfiles: 	Contains the graphical outputs for the manuscript
	- logfiles: 	Contains the log file for each script
