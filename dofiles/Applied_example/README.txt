# Applied example

These files can be run in order 0-4. 

As linked educational data was used in this project the initial dataset was created using file 0 on a local machine.

Data was then linked and files 1-4 were run on the secure UKSeRP server. See https://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/linkage/ for more information on accessing linked ALSPAC data.    
- File 1 sets the directories needed to run analyses. 
- File 2 creates a derived datset
- File 3 creates descriptive statistics
- File 4 performs all analyses
